# breast_cancer_project

Dear @Sean Morey, and @Felipe Rivera - TA , here is the final technical report:


Our team successfully completed the task under 4 hours. To get started we mobilized our technical team quickly and set up a slack channel. Our task was to separate out patients based on the mean of tumor radius for a research project. The final datasets were required to be saved in 5 different csv files.
First, the data had 570 records and about 32 columns. We checked for the missing data to make sure we had a reliable data set. We looked into the range and we found that the min radius was 6 and max was 28 of the radius mean of tumor. Before we moved forward with the analysis, we clarified a few details with you to get your guidance so thank you for that.


We created the datasets using equal ranges of mean radius per your guidance. We used the SQL to get this task done. We used pgAdmin13 to write the execute the query.

In addition, the project is uploaded to the GitHub project page where you can find these 5 different csv files. Our team was able to quickly organize a brainstorming meeting and come up with the ranges to divide the raw data into after which we were able to finalize the task. Our team spent around 3 hours on this project:


Here is the breakdown of hours spent on this project. The project files are saved on our GitHub page.
Breast Cancer Data Set is available here:

Brainstorming - initial meeting to chart out the project roadmap 40 mins
Review the raw data and come with clarification questions to the manager + send an email 20 mins
Create the database / schema for the data  20 mins
Separate out patients based on the mean of tumor radius using SQL /PG Admin13 15 mins
Written code to split the data into 5 equal tables/groups 20 mins
Create the final datasets in csvs  30 mins
Github collaboration time 20 mins
Look into bonus items  30 mins

Total time in minutes  195 mins or 3.25 hours
